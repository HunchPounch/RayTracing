# RayTracing
## Description:

There is some sort of viewpoint (camera) in space. Also in the space there is some three-dimensional structure (scene). Between them there is a rectangle divided into square pixels (screen).

The task of ray tracing is to draw a ray from the viewpoint through the center of each pixel of the screen - and see if it intersects any of the objects in the scene. If the ray intersects any of the objects, you need to paint the pixel with the desired color.
